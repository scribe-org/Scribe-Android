### Android app with keyboards for language learners

#### WIP port of [Scribe-iOS](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-iOS): see [Issues](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Android/issues)

**Scribe-Android** is a pack of Android keyboards for language learners. Features include translation **`(beta)`**, verb conjugation and word annotation that give users the tools needed to communicate with confidence.

Scribe is fully open-source and does not collect usage data or ask for system access. Feature data is sourced from [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/) and stored in-app, meaning Scribe is a highly responsive experience that does not require an internet connection.

> [!NOTE]\
> The [contributing](#contributing) section has information for those interested, with the articles and presentations in [featured by](#featured-by) also being good resources for learning more about Scribe.

Also available on [iOS](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-iOS), [Desktop](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Desktop) (planned) and for the data processes see [Scribe-Data](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Data).

Check out Scribe's [architecture diagrams](https://github.com/scribe-org/Organization/blob/main/ARCHITECTURE.md) for an overview of the organization including our applications, services and processes. It depicts the projects that [Scribe](https://github.com/scribe-org) is developing as well as the relationships between them and the external systems with which they interact.

### Data Edits [`‚áß`](#contents)

> [!NOTE]\
> Please see the [Wikidata and Scribe Guide](https://github.com/scribe-org/Organization/blob/main/WIKIDATAGUIDE.md) for an overview of [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/) and how Scribe uses it.

Scribe does not accept direct edits to the grammar JSON files as they are sourced from [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/). Edits can be discussed and the [Scribe-Data](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Data) queries will be changed and ran before an update. If there is a problem with one of the files, then the fix should be made on [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/) and not on Scribe. Feel free to let us know that edits have been made by [opening a data issue](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Android/issues/new?assignees=&labels=data&template=data_wikidata.yml) or contacting us in the [issues for Scribe-Data](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Data/issues) and we'll be happy to integrate them!

# Environment Setup [`‚áß`](#contents)

Scribe-Android is developed using the [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) coding language. Those new to Kotlin or wanting to develop their skills are more than welcome to contribute! The first step on your Kotlin journey would be to read through the [Kotlin documentation](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/getting-started.html). The general steps to setting up a development environment are:

1. Download [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)

2. [Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) the [Scribe-Android repo](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Android), clone your fork, and configure the remotes:

> [!NOTE]
>
> <details><summary>Consider using SSH</summary>
>
> <p>
>
> Alternatively to using HTTPS as in the instructions below, consider SSH to interact with GitHub from the terminal. SSH allows you to connect without a user-pass authentication flow.
>
> To run git commands with SSH, remember then to substitute the HTTPS URL, `https://github.com/...`, with the SSH one, `git@github.com:...`.
>
> -   e.g. Cloning now becomes `git clone git@github.com:<your-username>/Scribe-Android.git`
>
> GitHub also has their documentation on how to [Generate a new SSH key](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent) üîë
>
> </p>
> </details>

```bash
# Clone your fork of the repo into the current directory.
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Scribe-Android.git
# Navigate to the newly cloned directory.
cd Scribe-Android
# Assign the original repo to a remote called "upstream".
git remote add upstream https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Android.git
```

-   Now, if you run `git remote -v` you should see two remote repositories named:
    -   `origin` (forked repository)
    -   `upstream` (Scribe-Android repository)

3. Open the Scribe-Android directory in Android Studio

4. In order to [run Scribe on an emulator](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator):

    - In the top bar find and select the "Device Manager" option
    - [Create a device](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/managing-avds) and select it once it's been made
    - Press the play button marked "Run App"
    - From here code edits that are made will be reflected in the app each time it is ran.

After activating your emulator, consider setting up [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) to fix common errors in the codebase before they're committed by running:

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip  # make sure that pip is at the latest version
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install  # install pre-commit hooks
# pre-commit run --all-files  # lint and fix common problems in the codebase
```

> [!NOTE]
> Feel free to contact the team in the [Android room on Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/#ScribeAndroid:matrix.org) if you're having problems getting your environment setup!

<a id="app-setup"></a>

# App Setup [`‚áß`](#contents)

Users access Scribe language keyboards through the following:

-   Open the app and press **`Enable Keyboard`**
    -   Or: Settings -> System -> Languages & input -> On-screen keyboard -> Manage on-screen keyboards
-   Choose from the available Scribe language keyboards
-   When typing press üåê or the keyboard button to select keyboards

<a id="keyboard-features"></a>

# Keyboard Features [`‚áß`](#contents)

Scribe-Android is currently a work in progress and only has base keyboard functionality. The goal is to slowly add Scribe features before an initial release, and then iterate to match the functionality of [Scribe-iOS](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-iOS).

**Current features include:**

### ‚Ä¢ Base Functionality [`‚áß`](#contents)

The goal is for Scribe to have all the functionality of system keyboards. Currently the keyboards include:

-   Dynamic layouts for cross-device performance
-   Auto-capitalization following `.`, `?` and `!`
-   Typing symbols and numbers followed by a space returns keyboard to letters
-   Hold-to-select characters for letters and symbols
-   Key pop up views for letters and symbols
