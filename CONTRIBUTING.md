# Development environment [`â‡§`](#contents)

Scribe-Android is developed using the [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) coding language. Those new to Kotlin or wanting to develop their skills are more than welcome to contribute! The first step on your Kotlin journey would be to read through the [Kotlin documentation](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/getting-started.html). The general steps to setting up a development environment are:

1. Download [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)

2. [Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) the [Scribe-Android repo](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Android), clone your fork, and configure the remotes:

> [!NOTE]
>
> <details><summary>Consider using SSH</summary>
>
> <p>
>
> Alternatively to using HTTPS as in the instructions below, consider SSH to interact with GitHub from the terminal. SSH allows you to connect without a user-pass authentication flow.
>
> To run git commands with SSH, remember then to substitute the HTTPS URL, `https://github.com/...`, with the SSH one, `git@github.com:...`.
>
> -   e.g. Cloning now becomes `git clone git@github.com:<your-username>/Scribe-Android.git`
>
> GitHub also has their documentation on how to [Generate a new SSH key](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent) ðŸ”‘
>
> </p>
> </details>

```bash
# Clone your fork of the repo into the current directory.
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Scribe-Android.git
# Navigate to the newly cloned directory.
cd Scribe-Android
# Assign the original repo to a remote called "upstream".
git remote add upstream https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Android.git
```

-   Now, if you run `git remote -v` you should see two remote repositories named:
    -   `origin` (forked repository)
    -   `upstream` (Scribe-Android repository)

3. Open the Scribe-Android directory in Android Studio

4. In order to [run Scribe on an emulator](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator):

    - In the top bar find and select the "Device Manager" option
    - [Create a device](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/managing-avds) and select it once it's been made
    - Press the play button marked "Run App"
    - From here code edits that are made will be reflected in the app each time it is ran

> [!NOTE]
> Feel free to contact the team in the [Android room on Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/#ScribeAndroid:matrix.org) if you're having problems getting your environment setup!

## Pre-commit Hooks [`â‡§`](#contents)

Scribe-Android uses pre-commit hooks to maintain a clean and consistent codebase. These hooks help automatically check for issues such as formatting, trailing whitespace, and linting errors. Here's how to set up pre-commit for Scribe-Android:

1. Install `pre-commit` by running:

    ```bash
    pip install pre-commit
    ```

2. After cloning the repository, install the hooks by running the following command in the project root:

    ```bash
    pre-commit install
    pre-commit run --all-files  # to check
    ```

3. When you make a commit, the hooks will automatically run to check for any code quality issues. If any issues are found, they will either be fixed automatically or will need to be resolved manually.

## Testing [`â‡§`](#contents)

Scribe-Android includes a testing suite that should be ran before all pull requests and subsequent commits. Please run the following in the project root:

```bash
# Run ktlint and detekt:
./gradlew lintKotlin detekt
./gradlew test
```

If you see that there are linting errors above, then please run the following command to hopefully fix them automatically:

```bash
ktlint --format
```

# Issues and projects [`â‡§`](#contents)

The [issue tracker for Scribe-Android](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Android/issues) is the preferred channel for [bug reports](#bug-reports), [features requests](#feature-requests) and [submitting pull requests](#pull-requests). Scribe also organizes related issues into [projects](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Android/projects).

> [!NOTE]\
> Just because an issue is assigned on GitHub doesn't mean that the team isn't interested in your contribution! Feel free to write [in the issues](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Android/issues) and we can potentially reassign it to you.

Be sure to check the [`-next release-`](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Android/labels/-next%20release-) and [`-priority-`](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Android/labels/-priority-) labels in the [issues](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Android/issues) for those that are most important, as well as those marked [`good first issue`](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Android/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) that are tailored for first time contributors.

<a id="bug-reports"></a>

# Bug reports [`â‡§`](#contents)

A bug is a _demonstrable problem_ that is caused by the code in the repository. Good bug reports are extremely helpful - thank you!

Guidelines for bug reports:

1. **Use the GitHub issue search** to check if the issue has already been reported.

2. **Check if the issue has been fixed** by trying to reproduce it using the latest `main` or development branch in the repository.

3. **Isolate the problem** to make sure that the code in the repository is _definitely_ responsible for the issue.

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

-   A quick summary
-   Steps to reproduce
-   What you expected would happen
-   What actually happens
-   Notes (why this might be happening, things tried that didn't work, etc)

To make the above steps easier, the Scribe team asks that contributors report bugs using the [bug report](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Android/issues/new?assignees=&labels=feature&template=bug_report.yml) template, with these issues further being marked with the [`bug`](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Android/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Abug) label.

Again, thank you for your time in reporting issues!

<a id="feature-requests"></a>

# Feature requests [`â‡§`](#contents)

Feature requests are more than welcome! Please take a moment to find out whether your idea fits with the scope and aims of the project. When making a suggestion, provide as much detail and context as possible, and further make clear the degree to which you would like to contribute in its development. Feature requests are marked with the [`feature`](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Android/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Afeature) label, and can be made using the [feature request](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Android/issues/new?assignees=&labels=feature&template=feature_request.yml) template.

<a id="pull-requests"></a>

# Pull requests [`â‡§`](#contents)

Good pull requests - patches, improvements and new features - are the foundation of our community making Scribe-Android. They should remain focused in scope and avoid containing unrelated commits. Note that all contributions to this project will be made under [the specified license](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Android/blob/main/LICENSE.txt) and should follow the coding indentation and style standards ([contact us](https://matrix.to/#/#scribe_community:matrix.org) if unsure).

**Please ask first** before embarking on any significant pull request (implementing features, refactoring code, etc), otherwise you risk spending a lot of time working on something that the developers might not want to merge into the project. With that being said, major additions are very appreciated!

When making a contribution, adhering to the [GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html) process is the best way to get your work merged:

1. If you cloned a while ago, get the latest changes from upstream:

    ```bash
    git checkout <dev-branch>
    git pull upstream <dev-branch>
    ```

2. Create a new topic branch (off the main project development branch) to contain your feature, change, or fix:

    ```bash
    git checkout -b <topic-branch-name>
    ```

3. Commit your changes in logical chunks, and please try to adhere to [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).

> [!NOTE]
> The following are tools and methods to help you write good commit messages âœ¨
>
> -   [commitlint](https://commitlint.io/) helps write [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)
> -   Git's [interactive rebase](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/about-git-rebase) cleans up commits

4. Locally merge (or rebase) the upstream development branch into your topic branch:

    ```bash
    git pull --rebase upstream <dev-branch>
    ```

5. Push your topic branch up to your fork:

    ```bash
    git push origin <topic-branch-name>
    ```

6. [Open a Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) with a clear title and description.

Thank you in advance for your contributions!

# Data edits [`â‡§`](#contents)

> [!NOTE]\
> Please see the [Wikidata and Scribe Guide](https://github.com/scribe-org/Organization/blob/main/WIKIDATAGUIDE.md) for an overview of [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/) and how Scribe uses it.

Scribe does not accept direct edits to the grammar JSON files as they are sourced from [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/). Edits can be discussed and the [Scribe-Data](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Data) queries will be changed and ran before an update. If there is a problem with one of the files, then the fix should be made on [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/) and not on Scribe. Feel free to let us know that edits have been made by [opening a data issue](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Android/issues/new?assignees=&labels=data&template=data_wikidata.yml) or contacting us in the [issues for Scribe-Data](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Data/issues) and we'll be happy to integrate them!

<a id="localization"></a>

# Localization [`â‡§`](#contents)

Being an app that focusses on language learning, localization plays a big part in what Scribe will eventually be. Those interested are more than welcome to join the team at [scribe-org/Scribe-i18n](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-i18n) where we work on localizing all Scribe applications via [Weblate](https://weblate.org/).

Please run the [update_i18n_keys.sh](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Android/blob/main/update_i18n_keys.sh) script to load in the most recent version of the [Scribe-i18n](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-i18n) app texts into Scribe-Android.

Designs for Scribe are done in the [public design file in Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/c8945w2iyoPYVhsqW7vRn6/scribe_public_designs?node-id=405%3A464). Those interested in helping with Scribe's design are also welcome to share their ideas using the [design improvement](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Android/issues/new?assignees=&labels=design&template=design_improvement.yml) template that makes an issue marked with the [`design`](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Android/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Adesign) label.

All branding elements such as logos, icons, colors and fonts should follow those that are set out in [scribe-org/Organization](https://github.com/scribe-org/Organization). As the project is fully open source, these elements are also open for discussion. Efforts in making Scribe products professional with a distinct and cohesive identity are much appreciated!
