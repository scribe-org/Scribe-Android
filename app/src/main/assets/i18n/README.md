### Application text localization files for Scribe apps

**Scribe-i18n** is the home of the localization files that are included in each Scribe application. Scribe uses [Weblate](https://weblate.org/en/) for localization! Head over to [weblate.org/projects/scribe/scribe-i18n](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/scribe/scribe-i18n) to localize the applications. Changes in this directory will be merged into other Scribe applications via this repo being a [Git subtree](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/about-git-subtree-merges).

> [!NOTE]\
> The [contributing](#contributing) section has information for those interested.

Scribe apps are available on [iOS](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-iOS), [Android](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Android) (planned) and [Desktop](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Desktop) (planned). For the data formatting processes see [Scribe-Data](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Data) and for our data download API see [Scribe-Server](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Data).

Check out Scribe's [architecture diagrams](https://github.com/scribe-org/Organization/blob/main/ARCHITECTURE.md) for an overview of the organization including our applications, services and processes. It depicts the projects that [Scribe](https://github.com/scribe-org) is developing as well as the relationships between them and the external systems with which they interact.

Those interested in helping can check the [`-next release-`](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-i18n/labels/-next%20release-) and [`-priority-`](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-i18n/labels/-priority-) labels in the [issues](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-i18n/issues) for those that are most important, as well as those marked [`good first issue`](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-i18n/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) that are tailored for first time contributors. Generally issues in this repository will be marked with the [`localization`](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-i18n/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Alocalization) label.

### Localizing Via Weblate [`â‡§`](#contents)

<a href="https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/scribe/scribe-i18n"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/scribe-org/Organization/main/resources/images/logos/WeblateLogo.png" height="100" alt="Visit Weblate project" align="right"></a>

[Weblate](https://weblate.org/en/) localization is as easy as making an account and jumping into the Scribe-i18n project!

1. First [register at Weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/accounts/register/) (you can also authenticate with GitHub or other accounts)

   - We suggest that you do link your GitHub account so you get credit for the localization commits!

2. Navigate to the Scribe-i18n project at [weblate.org/projects/scribe/scribe-i18n](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/scribe/scribe-i18n)

3. Click on a language you want to start translating

4. You can browse the available strings or start translating directly

   - When translating a word, be sure to check the glossary context if you're not sure what the string's use is

   - You can also make use of Automatic suggestions to see machine translations if you need help

5. Hit `Save and continue` when you're ready to move to the next string

6. Maintainers will open up pull requests from [Weblate](https://weblate.org/en/) to the Scribe-i18n repo to bring in the new strings

   - Changes are also automatically sent every 24 hours

7. Scribe-i18n directories that are [Git subtrees](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/about-git-subtree-merges) in other Scribe application repos are then synched. For each project using Scribe-i18n:

   - Navigate to the root of the Scribe project's repo
   - To load into the project the latest Scribe-i18n updates, run the following - where `subtree-directory` is the directory within the repo structure with the Scribe-i18n subtree:

     ```bash
     git subtree pull --prefix <subtree-directory> git@github.com:scribe-org/Scribe-i18n.git main --squash
     ```

   - From the above command, two commits are then auto-generated. Finally, create the PR to the given project to bring in the Scribe-i18n updates.

Thanks so much for your interest in supporting Scribe's localization!

### Adding Source Strings [`â‡§`](#contents)

The base language for all Scribe applications is US English. If you'd like to edit the [en-US.json](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-i18n/blob/main/Scribe-i18n/en-US.json) file, please [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) the repo, clone your fork, and configure the remotes:

> [!NOTE]
>
> <details><summary>Consider using SSH</summary>
>
> <p>
>
> Alternatively to using HTTPS as in the instructions below, consider SSH to interact with GitHub from the terminal. SSH allows you to connect without a user-pass authentication flow.
>
> To run git commands with SSH, remember then to substitute the HTTPS URL, `https://github.com/...`, with the SSH one, `git@github.com:...`.
>
> - e.g. Cloning now becomes `git clone git@github.com:<your-username>/Scribe-i18n.git`
>
> GitHub also has their documentation on how to [Generate a new SSH key](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent) ðŸ”‘
>
> </p>
> </details>

```bash
# Clone your fork of the repo into the current directory.
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Scribe-i18n.git
# Navigate to the newly cloned directory.
cd Scribe-i18n
# Assign the original repo to a remote called "upstream".
git remote add upstream https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-i18n.git
```

- Now, if you run `git remote -v` you should see two remote repositories named:
  - `origin` (forked repository)
  - `upstream` (Scribe-i18n repository)

If all looks good, then you're ready to start adding localizable key-string pairs via pull requests!

### File Conversion

The files in the [Scribe-i18n/scripts](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-i18n/tree/main/Scribe-i18n/scripts) directory can be used to convert base localization JSON files into the filetypes that are needed for an application as well as the same in reverse. JSON files are automatically converted to their target files for Scribe applications after commits to the main branch, and their opposites can be used to update the JSON files when strings are first changed in the applications.

### Adding Scribe-i18n to Projects [`â‡§`](#contents)

To use Scribe-i18n within another repository, run the following command from the root directory of the project to add Scribe-i18n as a subtree:

```bash
git subtree add --prefix <subtree-directory> git@github.com:scribe-org/Scribe-i18n.git main --squash
```

In the command, the value for `subtree-directory` is a directory within the repo structure of the project. Which directory to use will be dependent on the stack of the project and how i18n files will be consumed. Typically, this is the path for a directory named `i18n` that will be created somewhere in the repo structure upon command execution. Refer to documentation of the tool that will consume the i18n files to determine what it should be.

### Pull Requests [`â‡§`](#contents)

Good pull requests are the foundation of our community making Scribe-i18n. They should remain focused in scope and avoid containing unrelated commits. Note that all contributions to this project will be made under [the specified license](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-i18n/blob/main/LICENSE.txt).

When making a contribution, adhering to the [GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html) process is the best way to get your work merged:

1. If you cloned a while ago, get the latest changes from upstream:

   ```bash
   git checkout <dev-branch>
   git pull upstream <dev-branch>
   ```

2. Create a new topic branch (off the main project development branch) to contain your feature, change, or fix:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b <topic-branch-name>
   ```

3. Commit your changes in logical chunks, and please try to adhere to [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).

> [!NOTE]
> The following are tools and methods to help you write good commit messages âœ¨

> - Git's [interactive rebase](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/about-git-rebase) cleans up commits

4. Locally merge (or rebase) the upstream development branch into your topic branch:

   ```bash
   git pull --rebase upstream <dev-branch>
   ```

5. Push your topic branch up to your fork:

   ```bash
   git push origin <topic-branch-name>
   ```
