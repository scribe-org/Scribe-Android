            The Scribe-i18n team will do our best to address your contribution as soon as we can. If you're not already a member of our [public Matrix community](https://matrix.to/#/#scribe_community:matrix.org), please consider joining! We'd suggest using [Element](https://element.io/) as your Matrix client, and definitely join the `General` and `i18n` rooms once you're in. Also consider attending our [bi-weekly Saturday dev syncs](https://etherpad.wikimedia.org/p/scribe-dev-sync). It'd be great to meet you üòä

            ## Maintainer Checklist

            The following is a checklist for maintainers to make sure this process goes as well as possible. Feel free to address the points below yourself in further commits if you realize that actions are needed :)

            - [ ] If i18n files are being added or edited, then the `convert_*.py` Python files in the [scripts directories](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-i18n/tree/main/Scribe-i18n/scripts) should be ran.

            ## First PR Commit Check

            - [ ] The commit messages for the remote branch should be checked to make sure the contributor's email is set up correctly so that they receive credit for their contribution
              - The contributor's name and icon in remote commits should be the same as what appears in the PR
              - If there's a mismatch, the contributor needs to make sure that the [email they use for GitHub](https://github.com/settings/emails) matches what they have for `git config user.email` in their local Scribe-i18n repo (can be set with `git config --global user.email "GITHUB_EMAIL"`)
